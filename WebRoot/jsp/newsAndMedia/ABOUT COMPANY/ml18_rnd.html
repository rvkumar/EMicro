<p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;Micro&nbsp;labs&nbsp;regard&nbsp;our&nbsp;Research&nbsp;&&nbsp;Development&nbsp;(R&D)&nbsp;capabilities&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;vital&nbsp;component&nbsp;of&nbsp;our&nbsp;business&nbsp;strategy&nbsp;that&nbsp;provide a sustainable, long-term 
competitive advantage. We have multi-disciplinary R&D centre's with cutting-edge enabling technologies for innovative research.</p>

<p>The Company's R&D strengths are in developing intellectual property in the area of generic formulations and novel drug delivery technologies for domestic, regulated and emerging markets. <br>
In the process, Micro labs is developing new drug delivery systems, new dosage formulations , applying innovative technology for improved drug deliveries.
Micro Labs has its presence in over 10 therapeutic categories with over 400 widely accepted brands. Most of these products are developed in-house through the Company's own R&D efforts. </p>

<p>The R&D division has dedicated research and development groups:<br>
<ui><li>The research group is engaged in the development of new technologies in the area of oral controlled release formulations, novel opthalmic formulations and topical drug delivery systems;</li>
<li>The development group is engaged in the development of various dosage forms like sterile injectables, opthalmic, solid dosage forms, liquids, among others. The generic products development is mainly focused on regulated markets such as those in the US, Canada and European markets; and
<li>Additionally, the R&D division undertakes projects for the WHO and PEPFAR.</li></ui></p>

<p>The R&D division has [2] R&D centres located at Bangalore and Mumbai in India:<br>
1. Bangalore R&D centre - The R&D centre comprises of the following [2] R&D facilities, which are staffed with a pool of highly qualified R&D scientists with a varied knowledge base and global exposure covering all areas of pharmaceutical research.  </p>

<p>(a) [2] formulation facilities located at [Kudulu] and [Hosur], spanning an area of [~45,000] sq. ft. and [~5,000] sq. ft. respectively. The development group at these 2 facilities has the infrastructure and capabilities for developing solid dosage forms, sterile liquid injectables, opthalmics, liquid orals, ointments, creams, among others; and</p>

<p>2. Mumbai R&D centre - The centre, located near the Mumbai International airport, spans an area of [~20,000] sq. ft. The development group at this centre has the infrastructure and capabilities for mainly developing the solid dosage forms.</p>

<p>Key features of the R&D centres include:<br>
<ui><li>Well equipped facilities with sophisticated equipment such as fluidized bed processors, modified compression machines to handle special formulations, and sophisticated instruments such as ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC), modified dissolution apparatus for analysis of special formulations, among others;</li> 
<li>Dedicated lab-scale sterile development facility and is equipped with its own pilot plant for scaling up of the developed products;</li>
<li>Dedicated areas to work on formulations like oro-dispersible, chewable tablets and others, which requires special environmental conditions; and</li>
<li>Separate analytical development and patent & regulatory affairs groups, which assist the formulation development groups in development of analytical methods, patent evaluations, patent filings and regulatory filings.</li></ui></p>

<tr><th>Overview of the R&D Capabilities</th></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>The Company has taken up various projects to carry out R&D activities in specified areas. </p>

<p>Some of the specific areas in which R&D is carried out include:<br>
1. Development of generic solid oral dosage forms for US, Canadian and European markets;<br>
2. Development of generic opthalmic and sterile liquid injectable formulations for US, Canadian and European markets;<br>
3. Development of fixed dose anti-TB combinations and antiretroviral for the WHO;<br>
4. Development of modified release drug delivery technologies for regulated and less regulated markets;<br>
5. Technology transfer of in-house developed and in-licensed products to various manufacturing sites;<br>
6. Commercialization of in-house developed new products;<br>
7. Development of multi-drug and multi-component release systems;<br>
8. Process and quality improvement projects; and<br>
9. Development of unique drug combination opthalmic dosage forms</p>

<p>The key R&D capabilities are as set out below:</p>
<p>Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) Dossiers:<br>
The Bangalore and Mumbai R&D centres have capabilities to develop generic products for the regulated markets such as US, Canada, Europe and Australia.</p>

<p>The development group at the Bangalore centre has the capability to develop solid dosage forms, sterile liquid injectables, opthalmics, liquid orals, ointments and creams. The development group at the Mumbai centre has the capability to develop mainly solid dosage forms.</p>

<p>The solid dosage form development is mainly focused on 'difficult-to-develop' generics, both in the immediate release and controlled release formulations. The approach for development is both as a Para III or Para IV (i.e. non infringing formulation), which is dependent on the molecule and the patent expiry. The R&D division has a number of pipeline products utilising both of these approaches.</p>

<p>Additionally, niche generic products such as opthalmic suspension, which require clinical studies, are also under development for the regulated markets.</p>

<p>The analytical development groups are engaged in the development of various methods including impurity profiling, dissolution methods, particle size 
characterisation and residual solvent identification.</p>

<p>Both the formulation development and analytical development groups are supported by an IPR cell, development quality assurance and regulatory affairs. </p>
</td></tr>
<tr><th><strong>Novel Drug Delivery Systems (NDDS)</strong></th></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>The NDDS research group in each R&D centre specializes in the development of drug delivery technologies. The focus areas of development for the group include oral controlled drug delivery systems, novel opthalmic formulations, bioavailability enhancement of poorly absorbable drugs, topical films, oro-dispersible technologies, among others. </p>

<p>The NDDS group concentrates on identifying the molecules which might require better patient compliance, reduce side effects, ease of administration, etc. 
Accordingly, the technology is identified and developed for such molecules. The technology developed is protected by filing patent application in various countries including India. The developed products are also subjected to pharmacokinetic studies and clinical trials.</p>
