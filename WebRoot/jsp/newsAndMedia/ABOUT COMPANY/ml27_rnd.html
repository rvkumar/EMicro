<p>Micro Labs R&D Centre located at Bommasandra Industrial area within municipal limits of
Bangalore, Karnataka & in the vicinity of big pharmaceutical majors like Biocon, Apotex, Cipla,
etc,. State-of-the-art R&D centre covers 40000 sq ft, is at par with international standards. Micro
Labs vision to encourage & promote the innovation lead to establishment of Research &
Development Centre (DSIR Approved) nurtured by research team of 150 scientists that
comprises of engineers, science graduates, recipients of prestigious Doctorates from well
known universities. Micro Labs API R&D centre is a star addition to the company's glittering
profile. The State-of-the-art R&D Centre equipped with advance cutting edge analytical
instruments like High field NMR (FT-400MHz), ICP-MS, LCMS-lon Trap, P-XRD, Ion
Chromatography, FTIR, GCMS, GCHS, UPLC, HPLC, Flash Chromatography, Lyophilizer,
Preparative LC, DSC, TGA & many more. An impressive R&D centre and Kilo level Scale-up
Lab facility is one of the key features of the unit, which enables to develop high value and low
volume APls. The modern facilities are a perfect complement to the talent of our product
development team. The research team can express their true potential, which in turn helps
Micro Labs to cater its products for the global market.</p>

<p>The R&D division and Kilo Lab facility of the API manufacturing unit devotes all its energies and
is constantly engaged with the exploration and development of APl's & NICHE molecules with
multi-step Chemical synthesis. Key focus areas include </p>

<p>(a) Development of Innovative & non-infringing routes for AP l's of global standard<br>
(b) Creating core competency in select therapeutic segments involving innovative chemistry</p>

<p>The API R&D division has developed strong skills in identification of non-infringing routes
supported with IPR [Intellectual Property Rights] cell thereby creating an 'IP capital' for the
company. </p>


<tr><th>Objective</th></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>Micro labs R&D strives to develop low cost APl's to serve the mankind. API R&D, Center
provides a nurturing environment to the scientists with clear objective to seed innovation in API
Research & Development for regulated markets. Micro labs R&D strength lies in developing
intellectual property in non-infringing processes and resolving complex chemistry problems.
R&D center is established with target of 15-20 molecules development each year. </p>
