Personal Usage

 </th></tr>

<tr>
<td>	
<li>General Mailing like Yahoo, Gmail, etc., will be allowed daily from 1.00pm to 1.30pm.</li>
	<li>Banking services will be allowed daily from 12.30pm to 1.30pm.</li>
<br>

Limited personal use is permitted where it:

	<li>Is infrequent and brief</li>
	<li>Does not interfere with the duties of the employee or his/her colleagues</li>
	<li>Does not interfere with the operation of Micro Labs</li>
	<li>Does not compromise the security of the Micro Labs systems</li>
	<li>Does not impact on Micro Labs's electronic storage capacity</li>
	<li>Does not decrease Micro Labs's network performance (e.g. large email attachments can decrease system performance and potentially cause system outages) </li> 
	<li>Corresponds to the procedures outlined in the Email Maintenance and Archiving Procedures document</li>
	<li>Conforms to the practices for file management and storage outlined in the current Technology Procedures Manual</li>
	<li>Does not incur any additional expense for Micro Labs</li>
	<li>Does not violate any laws</li>
	<li>Does not compromise any confidentiality requirements of Micro Labs<br><br></li>

Examples of what would be considered reasonable personal use are:</br>

	<li>Conducting a brief online bank transaction</li>
	<li>Paying a bill</li>
	<li>Sending a brief personal email, similar to making a brief personal phone call</br><br></li>
	
	
<b>
Permitted extended personal use</b> <br></br>

It is recognised that there may be times when staff need to use the internet or email for extended personal use.  An example of this could be when a staff member needs to use the internet to access a considerable amount of materials related to study they are undertaking.  In these situations it is expected that:</br>

	<li>The staff member advise and negotiate this use with the Manager</li>
	<li>The time spent on the internet replaces all or part of a staff member's breaks for that day, or that they adjust their timesheet accordingly for that day.</br></li>

It is not expected that staff need to advise or negotiate with the Manager for personal use that would be reasonably considered to be of a limited nature.
